module Chat
  # Gets a list of threads for a channel to be shown in an index.
  # In future pagination and filtering will be added -- for now
  # we just want to return N threads ordered by the latest
  # message that the user has sent in a thread.

  # @example
  #  Chat::LookupChannelThreads.call(channel_id: 2, guardian: guardian)

  class LookupChannelThreads

    # @!method call(channel_id:, guardian:)
    #   @param [Integer] channel_id
    #   @param [Guardian] guardian
    #   @return [Service::Base::Context]
