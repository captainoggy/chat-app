  # Handles counting unread messages and mentions scoped to threads for a list
  # of channels. A list of thread IDs can be provided to further focus the query.
  # Alternatively, a list of thread IDs can be provided by itself to only get
  # specific threads regardless of channel.
  #
  # This is used for unread indicators in the chat UI. By default only the
  # threads that the user is a member of will be counted and returned in
  # the result. Only threads inside a channel that has threading_enabled
  # will be counted.

    #  is used in tandem with channel_ids, it will just further filter the results of
    #  the thread counts from those channels.
    # @param user_id [Integer] The ID of the user to count for.
    # @param include_missing_memberships [Boolean] Whether to include threads
    #   that the user is not a member of. These counts will always be 0.
